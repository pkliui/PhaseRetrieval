# PhaseRetrieval: framework for solution of the phase problem.

Author: Pavel Kliuiev

PhaseRetrieval is a Python-based framework for solution of the phase problem widely encountered in optics. The framework incorporates the full workflow for phase retrieval: image pre-processing, reconstruction of images by phase retrieval algorithms and post-processing of reconstructed images (such as image registration).
